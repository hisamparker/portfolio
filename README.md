# Hi. This is my portfolio. 

Later I will put an image here ¯\_( ツ )_/¯ 

## Stuff && Things

This is my 3rd attempt at a portfolio. I am tired. It's a pretty simple React project. I hope you find it somewhat tollerable ᕦ⊙෴⊙ᕤ
## Tech && Things

HTML5, CSS (styled-components)
JavaScript / TypeScript ╰(◕ᗜ◕)╯
React (hooks, icons, router dom, transition group)
## Getting Started

If you want to copy my portfolio, that's pretty cool tbh. It would be real cute if you credit me... 

But also, please don't copy my portfolio because I am very new to React and you might learn wrong things!

You have been warned ᕙ( ~ . ~ )ᕗ

If you choose to copy anyways:

Clone my repo, then run

```shell
npm install
```

and after that start the live server

```shell
npm start
```

# If you clone my site and want to say thanks...
